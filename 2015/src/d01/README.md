# 2015::01 Not Quite Lisp

## Rubric summary

- `(` is up, `)` is down.
- What floor does the elevator go to? 

## Input files

These can be downloaded and put into `example.txt`, `example-spec.txt`, `input.txt` and `input-spec.txt`.

The expectation is that the spec files will contain a single number, which is the expected answer.

## Solution Sketch / Solving Notes

- A great way to use some simple techniques to pipe-clean. Can probably optimise further.
