## Rubric summary

Sum of total characters per line, across all lines.

- All strings double-quoted.
- The only escape sequences used are:
  - `\\` (which represents a single backslash)
  - `\"` (which represents a lone double-quote character), and 
  - `\x` plus two hexadecimal characters (which represents a single character with that ASCII code).

## Input files
