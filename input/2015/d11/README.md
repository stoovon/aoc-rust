## Rubric summary

Find next password given inputs

- Passwords must include one increasing straight of at least three letters, like abc, bcd, cde, and so on, up to xyz. They cannot skip letters; abd doesn't count.
- Passwords may not contain the letters i, o, or l, as these letters can be mistaken for other characters and are therefore confusing.
- Passwords must contain at least two different, non-overlapping pairs of letters, like aa, bb, or zz.

## Input files

These can be downloaded and put into e.g.
